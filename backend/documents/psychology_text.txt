In a Time Magazine article about cell-phone distracted parents, Dr. Tallie Baram suggests that distracted parental attention may have a negative impact on babies’ emotional development, especially their ability to process pleasure. Popular social media sites already hijack one’s pleasure center by creating addictive habits. So, with cell phone addiction being so popular these days, it is important that we know the effects that this can have on children. The study, which used rats as a model, could be relevant for parent-baby interactions in our technology-obsessed world.
	The researchers modified cages without sufficient material for nesting or bedding, causing mothers to give their babies interrupted and unreliable attention. When the offspring grew older, the researchers tested them on how much sugar solution they ate and how they played with their peers, two measures of how much pleasure the animals were feeling and a proxy for their emotional development. The rats raised in the modified environments consistently ate less of the sugar solution and spent less time playing and chasing their peers than the rats raised in the normal setting.
	The fact that the adolescent mice showed signs of compromised pleasure sensations suggests that just like with sensory systems like sight and hearing, there may be a critical period in which newborns need to be exposed to certain behaviors from the caregiver in order for their nervous system to develop properly. In this case, the lack of consistent, repetitive, and reliable attention appears to affect the animals’ ability to develop proper emotional connections to help them understand pleasure.
	For people, there might be a similar critical time during which babies need to have the parents’ reliable and consistent attention to form proper emotional processes, like knowing that food will come at a consistent time each day, or knowing when a toy will appear. However, if a parent is distracted by a call or text and decides to use their cell phone instead of paying attention to the child, then this pattern gets broken, and the crucial learning that should occur might not happen.
	The researchers plan to monitor the effects of inconsistent attention in human babies using brain imaging to look at potential differences in both structure and function of certain brain regions. They propose that there is a sensitive period in which maternal care needs to provide consistent patterns and sequences of behavior so the baby’s brain can perceive them to develop normally emotionally. 
	The study’s findings about the importance of consistent, repetitive, and reliable attention from caregivers for proper emotional development in infants are similar to attachment styles in infants. Attachment theory suggests that the nature of the bond between caregiver and infant can influence the child’s emotional and social development. The attachment style is determined by the quality and consistency of the caregiver’s response to the child’s needs. Insecure attachment styles, such as avoidant or anxious attachment, can result from inconsistent, unreliable, or neglectful responses from caregivers. The study’s findings add to the growing body of research on the importance of secure attachment and consistent caregiving for healthy emotional development in infants.
	In conclusion, the study’s findings have significant implications for parent-baby interactions in our technology-obsessed world. It suggests that distracted parental attention may sometimes have detrimental effects on babies’ development, especially their ability to process pleasure. The results highlight the critical importance of reliable attention from caregivers for proper emotional development in infants. This study reinforces the growing body of research that highlights the importance of secure attachment and consistent caregiving for healthy emotional development in infants. As technology use continues to become more prevalent, it is crucial to regulate cell phone usage when caring for children, especially during critical periods of emotional development. As more research emerges, it is increasingly important for caregivers to be aware of how modern technology impacts child development and to take steps to minimize its negative effects.
